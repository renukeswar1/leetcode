1: DNS

2: Load Balancer:
    Below are the algorithms:
       a: RoundRobin
       b: Less conneciton
       c: IP Hash: Client's IP is hashed and resulting value is used to determine which server the request should
       be redirected to . This method ensures that specific client's requests are consistently routed to same server,
       helping to maintain session persistence
3: API Gateway:
    Primary functions of API Gateway:
        1: Request Routing
        2: Request and Response transformation
        3: Caching
        4: Load balance
        5: Authoriazation & Authentiaction
        6: Rate Limiting  and Throtling

4: CDN
5: Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy

6:Caching:

7: Data Partitioning:
    In a database, horizontal partitioning, often referred to as sharding, entails dividing the rows of a
    table into smaller tables and storing them on distinct servers or database instances.
    This method is employed to distribute the database load across multiple servers, thereby enhancing performance.

    Conversely, vertical partitioning involves splitting the columns of a table into separate tables.
    This technique aims to reduce the column count in a table and boost the performance of queries that only
    access a limited number of columns.

8: Database Replication:
9: Distributed Message System
10: Microservices
11: NoSQL : Document Based(Mongo,couchDB) ,
            Key-VAlue(Redis,DynamoDB) ,
            Column Family(HBase,Cassandra) ,
            Graph- Based (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
12: Database Index:
        bitmap index
        hash index
        B-tree index
13: Distributed File System
14: Notification System
15: Full text search
16: Distributed Coordination services: Zookeeper,etcd ,and Consul
17: Heartbeat
18: Checksum: With checksum data will flow with out any corrupted data
    this can be calculated with cryptographic functions like MD5 , SHA-1,SHA-256
